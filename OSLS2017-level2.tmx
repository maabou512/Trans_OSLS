        <seg>and reduce the number
of n so we're combining some of events
but I'm going to talk about that in a
little bit one thing you might not know
about the Linux Foundation is we do a
lot of training we've trained over
800,000 students most of whom are take
our training courses at no cost we are
trying sure that the projects
that we work with have a set of
practitioners and developers that can
further increase the adoption of that
particular code not only that we have
training programs that are trying to
help the diversity in our communities
both in terms of gender we offer free
training scholarships for women's
organizations all over the world we've
also partnered with the goodwill in
Austin Texas where we're working with
people in poverty to give them job
skills technical skills through our
training curriculum and through a
hands-on mentor program to lift those
folks out of poverty single parents
folks who've seen hard times folks who
need good jobs a few
of the things we're doing around
training we're creating at the Linux
Foundation we did a little tally across
all the projects that just we're hosting
about 14 billion dollars worth of value
if you measure up the lines of code and
how much it cost on average to create a
line of code it's billions and billions
of dollars worth of value and certainly
Linux itself just continues to dominate
almost every aspect of modern computing
it runs almost all high performance
computing systems the majority of mobile
devices embedded systems most of the
world's economy the internet it's safe
to say runs on Linux so we're going to
continue and we hope all of you join us
and we know you're already working with
us to on those big outcomes
how can we really move the needle with
shared open-source software to really
make big impact on both industry and
society and you know one of the things
that I get asked about all the
I'm is you know you're doing so much
more than Linux when are you going to
change Foundation
and my response to that is I just made
up like all these vests and gave them
away to Africa pocket we're not change
in pin Hagan at least that for now but
no no name change but we really have
gone beyond Linux some of you may be
aware but many of you might not be aware
that of work around security
you're going to hear from Bruce Schneier
in a minute here about a world that is
facing increasing difficulty in trouble

皆さんがLinux Foundationについてご存知ないことかもしれませんが、我々は80万人におよぶ人たちにトレーニングを提供しています。大半の人たちは無料のコースを取っています。我々と一緒に取り組むプロジェクトが個々のコードの採用が広がるよう、開発者（Developer）と実際に活用する人（Practitioner)の両方を得られることを確かにしようと努めています。トレーニングプログラムを提供するだけではなく、ジェンダーの観点からもコミュニティにおける多様性を手助けしています。世界中の女性団体に対し無償の奨学金を提供しており、またテキサス州AustinにあるGoodwillともパートナー関係を結び[*]、貧困下にある人たちにトレーニングカリキュラムやハンズオンのメンタープログラムを通じ職能としての技術スキルを提供し、シングルパレントやつらい状況にあったりよい仕事を必要としてたりする人たちが貧困から脱する取り組みをしています。これらは、トレーニングに関連で我々がしていることの一部です。

we're (while?)creating at the Linux
Foundation, we did a little tally across
all the projects that just we're hosting
about 14 billion dollars worth of value
if you measure up the lines of code and
how much it cost on average to create a
line of code it's billions and billions
of dollars worth of value.
Linux Foundationでは創造的な活動をしているわけですが、ちょっとした勘定をしたところ、ホストしているすべてのプロジェクト横断でおよそ14Billion$の価値と値するという結果がでました。コードのライン数と一コードを生み出すの生じる平均コストから積み上げると、数十億ドルもの価値になるということです。

and certainly
Linux itself just continues to dominate
almost every aspect of modern computing
it runs almost all high performance
computing systems, the majority of mobile
devices, embedded systems most of the
world's economy the internet it's safe
to say runs on Linux .
so we're gonna 
continue and we hope all of you join us
and we know you're already working with
us to really focus on those big outcomes.
how can we really move the needle with
shared open-source software to really
make big impact on both industry and
society.
たしかにLinuxそれ自身、実に近代のコンピューティングのほとんどすべての側面で優勢であるわけです。ハイパフォーマンスコンピューティングシステムほとんどすべて、モバイルデバイスのや組込みシステムの大多数で動いていますし、世界経済やインターネットのほとんどがLinux上で動いているといっても過言ではありません。私たちは進み続けていきます。そして、皆さんに参加していただきたいです。こういった成果（outcome）にフォーカスするべくすでに一緒に取組んでいるわけではありますが。産業や社会にインパクトを与えるには、共有されるオープンソース・ソフトウェアでどのように変化をもたらすことができるでしょうか？



and you know one of the things
that I get asked about all the
time  is you know you're doing so much
more than Linux when(why not) you are gonna
change the name of the Linux Foundation
and my response to that is I just made
up like all these vests and gave(give?)  them
away  if you want, we're not changing the name 
at least that for now .but...
no no name change. 
but we really have
gone beyond Linux.


よく聞かれることの一つに、「Linux以外にも多くの取組みをしているなら、Linux Foundationという名前を変えないのか」という話がある。私の応えとしては、このベストを作ってしまいましたし、欲しい人にはお配りもしますので、変えるつもりはありません。少なくとも今のところは、変えません（笑）しかしながら、実際我々はLinuxを越えた活動をしていますね。

some of you may be
aware but many of you might not be aware of
that we are a lot of work around security
you're going to hear from Bruce Schneier
in a minute here about a world that is
facing increasing difficulty in trouble
when it comes to cyber security privacy
and other things.
we have an initiative
or that we're working with here called
let's encrypt. Is there anyone here from the
let's encrypt projects? a few people,some folks.
何人かの方はご存知かもしれませんが、多くの人は我々がセキュリティ関連の取り組みを多くしている点をご存知ないかもしれません。この後でBruce Schneier[*]から今直面している、増加傾向にあるサイバーセキュリティやプライバシーといったことに関する問題について話を聞くことができると思います。我々が取り組んでいるイニシアチブに「Let's Encrypt!」があります。Let's encryptプロジェクトから来ている人はいますか？何人かいらっしゃいますね。

in the networking sector we have lots of
new open source projects and that's only
getting bigger we're working with the
largest global operators in the world
you're going to hear this week from
organizations like AT&amp;T last year we

「Let's Encrypt!」はフリーの認証局です。背景にあるアイデアは、インターネットのデフォルトであるHTTP接続を、フリーの認証局を作ることによってすべてセキュアなインターネットトラヒックにするということです。2016年インターネットトラヒックのうちセキュアなものが初めて50%を越えました。この大部分はLet's Encrypt!のおかげで、Let's Encryptがスタートしたところでインターネットを流れるセキュアなトラヒックの値が上に触れる図を示すことができます。我々としては、これをできる限り高いところに持っていきたいとところです。

Core Infrastructure Initiativeは グローバルなインターネットで非常に高いセキュリティが重要となるところと資金を得られないなど「間違いが生じてしまった（Screwed-up）ところ」が交差するところにいるプロジェクトと一緒になった取組みをしています。OpenSSLやnptdその他プロジェクトで見られるように第三者監査を求めるプロジェクトもあれば、コードを見るより多くの目（eyeball)を必要とするプロジェクトもいます。

私たち、本イニシアチブでは全てのオープンソースプロジェクトでセキュアコーディングが実践される文化を創り出そうとしていて、社会にとって重要で、リソースを得ることができなかったオープンソースのプロジェクトにファンドやその他リソースを提供することで正しい方向に向かうことを支援しているのです。

a little linux
foundation is at this year this is our
annual member event and we're really
happy year
we just at this
event this been a good
year for the linux foundation in 2017 is
already shaping up to be a really good
year you know one of the things that
we're really focused on is having a big
impact on creating the greatest shared
technology investment in the world and
it's not just us you know our mission
really is to create the largest share of
technology investment in the world by
making open source code available for
anyone to use to propose it's
not just the Linux Foundation there are
other foundations it's Mike malinka
bitching around here somewhere from the
Eclipse right there Mike malinka bitch
from the Eclipse Foundation in the back
of the room there thank you for coming
his organization like ours is again
dedicated to the same thing to
make a lot of source code available to
as many people as possible and on the
linux foundation's and to that end we've
had in the number of
organizations and people that we work
with I think the 827 member companies
the most foundation is already out of
date like Michael boosters around here
somewhere we it's about 50 out of date
so we're going to we're going to
probably break a thousand organizations
participating in the Linux Foundation
this year which is a big milestone the
thing I'm most proud about that is the
fact that companies that are coming in
now from wholesale new sectors that
hadn't done a lot of open source work in
the past telecom automotive etc are
really learning how to do shared
software development understanding the
intellectual property regimes that open
source represent and just sort of
greasing the skids for broader low of
code which is incredibly important if
your admission is to create the greatest
shared technology resource in the world
last year we had over 20,000 attendees
at 150 events from 85 different
countries it's it is crazy where is
Angela and her team around here
somewhere let's give them a quick round

from the Eclipse Foundation in the back
of the room there thank you for coming
his organization like ours is again
dedicated to the same thing. We wanna
make a lot of source code available to
as many people as possible.

では少し今年Linux Foundationがどこにいるのか、という点について少々アップデートしたいと思います。本イベントはアニュアルメンバーのイベントで、今回400人超の方々に参加してもらったことを大変うれしく思います。昨年はLinux Foundationにとって大変よい年でした、2017年も大変よい年になる形になってきています。一つは、我々が注力しているのは、世界最大の共有されたテクノロジ投資（The greatest Shared Technology Investment in The World)を生み出すことに影響を与えるということです。私たちのミッションは、オープンソースのコードを誰にでも利用できるようにすることで、世界で最も大きなテクノロジーへの投資を作り出すことですが、もちろんそれは我々に限った話ではありません。さまざまなファンデーションが存在しています。Mike Milinkovich[*2]はいますか？彼は、Eclipse Foundationからの参加です。ありがとうございます。彼の組織は我々と同じことに献身しています、我々は多くのソースコードをできるだけ多くの人たちに使えるえるようにしたいのです。

and on the
linux foundation's end to that end we've
had massive increase in the number of
organizations and people that we work
with I think the 827 member companies
of Linux  foundation,it's already out of
date like Michael boosters around here
somewhere we it's about 50 out of date
so we're going to we're going to　
probably break a thousand organizations
participating in the Linux Foundation
this year  which is a big milestone.
Linux Foundationのこういった目的に向かい、我々と一緒に取組んでくれる多くの組織や人による参加が増えています。827のメンバ企業とありますが、これはすでに古い情報です。Mike Woster(?)[*]はいますか？どうも50社分ぐらい古いようなので、今年に参加する組織は1000を突破するかもしれませんね。これは大きなマイルストーンです。

私がもっても誇らしいと思うことは、過去オープンソースの取り組みをしてこなかったテレコムや自動車産業といった大規模で新しいセクタから今参画しててきていることです。また我々は、オープンソースに象徴的な知的財産（IP）の体系を理解したり、最大の共有可能なテクノロジのリソースを生み出すミッションにおいて非常に重要となるコードの流通を円滑にしたりしすることで共有型のソフトウェア開発をいかにシェアするかということを学んでいるのです。

last year we had over 20,000 attendees
at 150 events from 85 different
countries it's it is crazy where is
Angela and her team around here
somewhere let's give them a quick round
of applause.
we're gonna add another 50
events this year xxx?? Angela
screaming right or not.
actually we are getting to try 
and reduce the number
and so we're combining some of events
but I'm going to talk about that in a
little bit
昨年度は85か国で150のイベントを開始し、2万人を越える方々に参加いただきました、クレイジーですね。Angela [*]と彼女のチームがいますので拍手をお願いします。今年は50のイベントを追加予定です。Angelaが叫んでいるかもしれませんね。実際は開催数を減らし、いくつかのイベントを合体させていきますが、後程少し触れてたいと思います。
