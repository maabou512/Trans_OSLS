        <seg>ようこそカルフォルニアSquaw Valleyへ。みなさん泊まったとと思いますが問題はなかったですか（会場笑い）昨年よりは悪くなったでしょう。このイベントの最後に来年の開催地をアナウンスしますが、さらにたどり着くのが大変なところになります。みなさん参加できますので、夜のレセプションも忘れずに。マッドスライド（カクテル名）を楽しみましょう。まだ早い？（笑）あと、バレンタインデーですね、一緒に過ごしてくれてありがとう。このイベントは広げたいですが、来年度はバレンタインデーには当たらないようにしないといけませんね。</seg>

locks of open source are at this event
this week and what we've done is

        <seg>このイベントで大事なのは、みなさんがお互いによい関係を作っていく、ということでしょう。その目的にむかって、ぜひしてほしいと思うのは、いままで知らなった人と今週知り合いになってほしいということです。今年の参加者は、信じられないくらいスペシャルです。オープンソースのあらゆる切り口のグループの人たちが来ています。Open Source Program Officeを率いている人もいれば、世界最大のオープンソースプロジェクトをマネージしている人もいて、かたやテレコム領域で何10億人もの加入者向けにオープンソースをデプロイしている人もいれば、自動車向けにオープンソースを使う人もいます。まさにオープンソースの頼れる人たち（Rocks)がこのイベントに来ているということで、私たちはみなさんが知り合いになりネットワークができるよい機会となるようスケジュールを作りました。ぜひこの機会を活用してください。</seg>

        <seg>take advantage of
that that opportunity I do want to take
a minute to thank our sponsors including
Intel VMware Delhi MC and IBM let's give
them a quick round of applause as i
mentioned we're having a reception
tonight at five thirty in the ballroom
fire again mud slides will be available
in addition to beer and wine and then
tomorrow going to have
themed receptions throughout the hotel
this will be an opportunity for people
to go to sort of different thematic
network get-togethers and really again
get to know each other so that we can
all do good work together in the future
and then we also have an open space for
unconference session so if you have a
topic you'd like to discuss ah the
signup board is in the foyer so just go
ahead and find the unconference session
sign up and people will be able to do
that as well so again I want to thank
all of you for coming and then give you
a little linux
foundation is at this year this is our
annual member event and we're really
happy year
we just at this
event this been a good
year for the linux foundation in 2017 is
already shaping up to be a really good
year you know one of the things that
we're really focused on is having a big
impact on creating the greatest shared
technology investment in the world and
it's not just us you know our mission
really is to create the largest share of
technology investment in the world by
making open source code available for
anyone to use to propose it's
not just the Linux Foundation there are
other foundations it's Mike malinka
bitching around here somewhere from the
Eclipse right there Mike malinka bitch
from the Eclipse Foundation in the back
of the room there thank you for coming
his organization like ours is again
dedicated to the same thing to
make a lot of source code available to
as many people as possible and on the
linux foundation's and to that end we've
had in the number of
organizations and people that we work
with I think the 827 member companies
the most foundation is already out of
date like Michael boosters around here
somewhere we it's about 50 out of date
so we're going to we're going to
probably break a thousand organizations
participating in the Linux Foundation
this year which is a big milestone the
thing I'm most proud about that is the
fact that companies that are coming in
now from wholesale new sectors that
hadn't done a lot of open source work in
the past telecom automotive etc are
really learning how to do shared
software development understanding the
intellectual property regimes that open
source represent and just sort of
greasing the skids for broader low of
code which is incredibly important if
your admission is to create the greatest
shared technology resource in the world
last year we had over 20,000 attendees
at 150 events from 85 different
countries it's it is crazy where is
Angela and her team around here
somewhere let's give them a quick round
of applause
what we're going to add another 50
events this year aunt Angela
